# base-install.sh

This script handles a lot of the basics I like to do on nearly all my Ubuntu 24.04 LTS installs. Most of which I've been doing since Ubuntu 16.

**Warning: This disables password based SSH authentication so make sure your SSH keys are setup**

You can execute it directly by running this, if you've inspected the script and trust it:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannyferguson/linux-scripts/refs/heads/master/base/ubuntu24/base-install.sh)
```
